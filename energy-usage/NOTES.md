Candidate Name: Arnaldo Tema

Tasks: 2 and 3

Time: ~4h

Notes:
 I've also notice some funny behaviour with the final calculation and the dates with Moment (For example, the API only accepts inserting meter readings that are not the 1st or last day of the month), but I'd easily fix that if I was given a little bit more time - I tried to be compliant with the expected durations per exercise. I've also decided to build a endpoint unit testing aproach, giving the fact the platform aims to supply a specific need -> dashboarding. I'd also like to add that, with more time, I would tackle the remaining features in terms of unit testing, would build a more modular architecture and be more careful with variable naming and standardisation.
